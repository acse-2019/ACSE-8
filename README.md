## Learning outcomes:

On successfully completion of this module, students will be able to:

1.	Describe and critique the main categories of Machine Learning methods: Supervised Learning (Regression/Classification) and Unsupervised Learning (Dimensionality Reduction). 
2.	Describe and critique the basic probability definitions and tools used in Deep Learning  (MultiGaussian and Bernouilli pdfs, Maximum Likelihood, Cross-Entropy, Monte-Carlo Simulation, Change of Variables, Kullback-Leibler Divergence).
3.	Describe, implement and use: Logistic Regression algorithms; feed-forward Neural Networks; Convolutional Neural Networks; Generative Convolutional Neural Networks such as (Variational) Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.
